## About

(Don't) Fear the Reaper is a project built for VR headsets (in this case, the Oculus Quest 1) that showcases some fear.  The scope of this project can be serious or humorous, but we must still help our user face this fear.  In this case, we have a fear of sensible dreams.  Many times our dreams do not make sense, and thus, we may wonder if our state of mind is something to be concerned over.  Our goal is help the user realize that while there may be many nonsensible things here, it is still just a dream.  There is absolutely nothing to worry about.  

We start out rather tame: inside of the classroom with our Prof. Andrew Johnson at the front.  However, you'll notice... a bean man?  Um, let's not look at him for now.  The sign next to him says to feed the plants.  Perfect, something normal.  Go ahead and enter the cubicles and water some plants.  Don't forget to grab the blue mug full of water!  Be careful: if the plants die, their spirits will haunt you...
